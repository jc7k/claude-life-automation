## ü§ñ Subagents (Backend Processors)

**Important:** These subagents are NOT standalone - they're automatically triggered by their parent commands. You don't need to interact with them directly.

### Command-Triggered Subagents

| Subagent | Triggered By | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `metrics-analyst` | `/weekly-checkin` | Creates visual progress reports with trends and recommendations |
| `daily-reflection` | `/daily-checkin` | Analyzes daily patterns for personal growth insights |
| `content-researcher` | `/newsletter-research` | Finds trending topics and content opportunities |
| `newsletter-writer` | `/newsletter-research` | Writes newsletter drafts in your voice |
| `insight-extractor` | `/brain-dump-analysis` | Identifies patterns and connections in brain dumps |
| `brain-dump-analyst` | `/brain-dump-analysis` | Creates visual summaries and action items |
| `interest-analyzer` | `/daily-brief` | Discovers your interests from project context |
| `news-curator` | `/daily-brief` | Finds and filters relevant news with explanations |

**Note:** The subagents work in sequence - for example, `/newsletter-research` first triggers `content-researcher` to analyze trends, then passes those insights to `newsletter-writer` to create the draft.
