# Brain Dump Analysis

Extract insights from stream-of-consciousness writing.

## Process:

1. **Scan Brain Dumps**
   - Scan my brain dumps folder (or create one at `/braindumps/`)
   - Read all my brain dump files
   
2. **Launch Insight Extractor Subagent**
   - Identifies recurring themes and patterns
   - Tracks how my thinking evolves over time
   - Finds hidden connections between ideas
   - Extracts key questions I keep asking
   - Highlights breakthrough moments
   - Uses my own words when possible

3. **Launch Brain Dump Analyst Subagent**
   - Creates a visual mind map of my thoughts
   - Lists my top 10 realizations (in my exact words)
   - Shows thinking evolution timeline
   - Generates action items I mentioned
   - For creators: adds content ideas based on insights
   - Makes everything visual with ASCII art and emojis

4. **Save Analysis**
   - Save comprehensive analysis to `/braindumps/analysis/analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Include both personal insights and optional content ideas

## Key Features

The system should:
- Find patterns I can't see myself
- Show how my ideas connect and evolve
- Extract wisdom from my chaotic thoughts
- Make insights actionable
- Celebrate my thinking and growth

Output both personal insights (for everyone) and content ideas (for creators).
